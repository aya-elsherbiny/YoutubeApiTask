 Routing (Home and Details Page)
 
 Search in table
 
 Pagination using ngx pagination
 
 Simple caching using local storage
 
 Adding favorite list (full video data and its rating) to local storage and showing them from the button in home page.
 
 Adding favorite list (the video's title, image, id and rating) to firebase and showing them using show favorite in details page (after adding to favorites click yes to view favouriteList). it can also add the full video Info to the firestore but I prefered sending the data that I will only retrieve and view in the modal.
 
 All the images are clickable and redirects to the youtube page of the video.
